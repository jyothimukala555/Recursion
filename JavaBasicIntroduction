//Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems’ Java platform.
//The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
//Java is concurrent, object-oriented, and intended to let application developers “write once, run anywhere” (WORA).
//The Oracle implementation is packaged into two different distributions:
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which contains the parts of the Java SE platform required to run Java programs and is intended for end users.
Java Development Kit (JDK) which is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as the Java compiler, Javadoc, Jar, and a debugger.
