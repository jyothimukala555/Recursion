Types of variables----
A. Based on value:
-----------------
a. primitive variables: used to represent primitive values.
eg: int x=10;
b.Reference variables: used to refer objects.
eg: Student s = new Student();
===========================================================================
B. Based on Position of declaration and behaviour
a.Instance variable
b.Static variable
c.Local variable

Instance Variable:
------------------
1.If value of variable is varied from object to object such type of variables is called instance variables.
2.For every object a separate copy of instance variables will be create.
eg: name of student and roll number is different for every object(Student).Here Student is an object.
3.Instance variable should be declared within the class directly but outside of any method/block/constructor.
Instance variable is always part of object.
4.Instance variable will be created at the time of creation and destroyed at the time of object destruction. Hence scope of instance variable is same as scope of object.
