Let us note down a few important observations from this program:

public means that all other classes can access it.
static means that we can run this method without creating an instance of HelloWorld.
void means that this method doesnâ€™t return any value.
main is the name of the method.
String[] is the type that is used to refer to text content in Java. The [ ] brackets indicate that it is of array type.
args is the name of the method argument, which is of type String[]. It means that the main method can accept multiple text inputs while starting the program execution. These arguments are generally user inputs to the program.
