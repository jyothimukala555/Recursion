/*The keywords are predefined, reserved words that have a very specific meaning for the compiler. 
These keywords cannot be used as variables, methods, classes, or any other identifiers.

In the following statement, int is a keyword that indicates that the variable age is of integer type (32-bit signed two’s complement integer). 
We can’t use int as a variable name etc. Using keywords as identifiers will result in compilation errors.
